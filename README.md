# HelloWorld-ReactNative
Goal: Create a simple Hello World react native project.

## Objectives:
1. Set up programs, dependencies, and libraries
2. Become familiar with React Native code structure
3. Set up testing environment

## Why?
Creating a new project in a new framework is never as simple as open a vim terminal and start coding. I have created enough projects across many different coding frameworks to realize there are always unexpected, time consuming nonsense like:
* installing new cli tools
* updating old cli tools
* running into installation problems not shown in tutorials
* downloading new software / apps
* creating new accounts I will forget about

## Achievements
✅ **Set up programs, dependencies, and libraries**
* Succesfully updated `npm` 
* Succesfully installed `expo`

✅ **Become familiar with React Native code structure**
* Succesfully changed template text with custom text

✅ **Set up testing environment**
* Learned how to use `expo start` to run code and open Android / iOS simulators
* Downloaded ExpoGo to smartphone to test app on physical device
* Created Expo account (*sigh*)
* Succesfully scanned a QR code 
* Deployed "app" to smartphone
